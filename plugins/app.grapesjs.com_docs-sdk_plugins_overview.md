## What is a Plugin? [​](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/plugins/overview\#what-is-a-plugin "Direct link to What is a Plugin?")

A plugin is an extension that enhances the core functionality of the editor through functions that are run when the editor is initialized. Plugins allow you to introduce new features, modify existing behaviors, or integrate external libraries without altering the core logic.

By using plugins, developers can customize the canvas to fit specific use cases, whether it's adding new components, or extending the editor's capabilities.

## Why use Plugins? [​](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/plugins/overview\#why-use-plugins "Direct link to Why use Plugins?")

Plugins are essential for keeping the editor modular, scalable, and adaptable to different needs. Here's why you should use plugins:

- **Customization**: Extend the platform with tailored functionality for your project.
- **Reusability**: Create reusable features without modifying the core editor.
- **Integration**: Easily connect external libraries or APIs.
- **Maintainability**: Keep core updates separate from custom modifications.
